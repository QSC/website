		<h3> About Us </h3>
		<h5> What is the Queen's Space Conference? </h5>
		<p class="paragraphs">
			The Queen's Space Conference (QSC), held at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, is an annual, non-profit, student-run conference focused on connecting undergraduate students with Space industry leaders. The conference is centered around a series of exciting talks, innovative workshops, and networking opportunities.
			</p>
		<p class="paragraphs">
			We strive to bring together industry professionals in order to provide delegates the most informative, inspiring, and memorable conference possible. QSC is about sparking thought and idea-generation, about raising the awareness of the potential of the space industry, and about piquing the interest of the future generation of that industry.
				</p>
		<p class="paragraphs">
			This year, QSC will take place February 3rd to 5th at the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel located within walking distance of downtown Kingston. This promises to be the best space conference yet!
